      So I was actually planning to give you this on your birthday but because of A/ls that couldn't happen neh.  
      Hopefully at least you will get to read this lol.  

      Well props to me if I was actually able to go with the plan and give you thiss cuz at the moment I'm writing this, I still haven't figured out how to do that tbh.  
      <br><br>

      I thought you might need a lil break from everything (including my yapping) after busting yo ass for the exams so I thought,  
      "why not cramm everything I wanted to tell you in one go?":)).  

      Anyways, you told me that the first thing you gonna do after the exams is to take a long breakk and go somewhere far away neh XD.  

      Regardless whether you are going to do A/ls again or not, I say you ought to take a break from everything because you truely deserve it after everything that you had to go through.  
      <br><br>

      I hope you start writing poems again hehe. Ya know.. I read that poem you published. That one there was a gawddamn masterpiece.  
      How come you never told me about that before? >_<.  

      The words, the meaning, the depth, everything was beyond elegant.  
      I hope I get to see more of those sooner or later hehhe.  

      Are you gonna pick up watching movies and tv series stuff again? I hope you doo.  

      I knoww I knoww.. you ain't into anime that much and it's very understandable.  

      Buuuut ;)...
      It's my job to convince you try out anime when you get time. I don't care about any others but at least you've gotta try out 'One Piece' loll.  

      I know you'd be like "1000 episodes? Aww hell nahh.. I ain't watching allat" now XD.  
      But come on, give it a try. Just a few episodes at least.  

      If you want you can read the comic(manga) since that takes way less time than watching the whole thing.  

      I want your honest opinion about it laterr aight? (You can be brutally honest and harshh but you gotta give it a try first harithoo? XD XD)  

      Damn I sound like a total weeb -_- but fuck it. "I'm only goin' to get this one chance.." XD.  
      <br><br>

      By the way there's this lil thing I keep thinking about daily over and over, that we talked about ya know.  

      You remember we talked about hanging out irl sometime?  

      I know, I knoww you made it crystal clear, that you'd be down with it<b> only after</b> being all done with a/ls, since you told before that you wanna sit for it again on next year August neh.  
      (If you ain't gonna.. its a hooray hoorayy :D).  

      I'm not saying that you have to.. but could you give it a bit of thought so that perhaps it would be possible for us to hangout before then? :')  

      We could probably go watch a movie, grab something to eat, or go for a walk, or shopping, or whatever you likeee, like a typical dayout.  

      If you can, just give it a thought. I'm not saying immediately, ofc not. Prolly after your break, whenever you get a free time UwU.  
      <br><br>

      A quick heads up for the next one...  

      Well I thought I'd fill it with some stuff I think that you would enjoy.. but I think I might've overthought about them a lil bit and I actually couldn't decide on anything smh.  

      So instead I filled it with some stuff in my collection:').  

      (A perfect opportunity for you to judge my taste heh heh).
