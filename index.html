    Congrats on turning 20🥳 less goo. You've got no idea how proud and happy I am for you right now.<br> 
    2 decades gone by since you landed here on earth and I am pretty glad that you did. <br>
    Seriously though, I'm genuinely grateful for being able to watch you grow into the amazing person you are.<br> 
    I'm sure there are a lot of good things stored for you in the future and you deserve them all. <br>
    Thank you for being who you are. You really do make everything a little brighter.
