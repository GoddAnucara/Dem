    <p> First of all, this all might seem pretty out of the blue for you, right? Well to be honest with you, this idea had been in my head for ages. During the time I was at home because of the accident and had nothing to do, I started this lol. I wanted this to express my honest feelings to you, so that’s why I created this space. I really don’t want to bring up the past between us cause I know you won’t like it. But there are some fragments, some loose ends and I kinda wanna clear them up. Therefore, can you bear with me for a moment? 
     <br><br>           
        

        Let’s roll back to 14th of January 2016. That’s the day I first met- met you (We might have met earlier but I honestly don’t remember much about the primary days😭). I remember we both had errors in our resignation certificates and had go back and fix them. Heck I even remember your school admission number- 30814😂. Anyways I remember looking back at you while you were walking down the stairs and I guess that was the moment. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kFxNrUTkGpc"> This<a> would be pretty accurate about my reaction at that time to be honest 😂.  Fast forwarding to the O/L days I think I got really lucky when I actually got to know you better. Because we had a lot in common. Mutual interests, same subjects and much more. Because of those reasons, you became one of the 2 closest friends in my life and I’m so grateful for that. 
    <br><br>    
        

        I might not be accurate but it was after O/Ls that I confessed right? I won’t lie that there were ups and downs, but I’ve gotta tell you those were some of the happiest days of my life. There were times when we didn’t message for weeks for no apparent reason and there were days we texted from day to night and night to day, many hours straight. Do you remember the day you went to watch ‘Avatar: The way of water’ with your friends? I think that particular day was the day I realized I was at the epitome of happiness and there is nothing but a downfall from that point on, because I was happy asf 😂. You probably don’t even remember why that day was so special lol. Even though we used talk and yap about lots of random stuff, on that day specifically you made me feel like I was right there next to you. You were sending snaps, texting and letting me know how your day was going. That kinda made me really happy ya know. And like any story, this one also has ups and downs right 🥲? From my POV I think the downfall started when it started getting harder and harder to meet you after them a/l classes. It’s understandable that that wasn’t in your interest to have an IRL conversation at that time but nevertheless, my dumbass kept trying. It’s embarrassing really, but looking back at it, it is kinda funny as well, not gonna lie. There were times I waited for hours to catch the same bus as you, just for that bus to not stop at my stop or somehow my ADHD ass brain to completely miss.  
    <br><br>    
        

        Ah that reminds me, that ‘pikachu’ statue thing in the bag, I actually bought it for your 17th birthday back in 2022 but that dumbass thing came like 2 days after your birthday 😂. So my dumbass thought of giving you it on the valentine's week. Some unfortunate circumstances and that also didn’t happen as well neh 😂. Anyways after that everything came crashing down and I don’t think it’s anyone’s fault (but if we had to pick, I’d say it's mine lol). Looking back at it from an objective POV I think it was the best thing that could have happened. I really can’t talk on your behalf confidently as I do mine, but I think we were kinda a bit immature right? Me especially, there were lots of flaws in my character. Well I’ll be honest with you, I was kinda obsessed with the idea of us being together and tried to push all the pieces in that direction. It was to the point that I was depending on your existence so much that I couldn't even imagine a world without you. Man, I’m glad that I got over that period 😂. It’s safe to say I came a long way from that really. Anyways, you knew me back then, introverted and shy and stuff (I still am) and more than that, I don’t think I took a moment to step back to understand my own feelings and express them properly in way that a proper human being can understand. Another way to say it is that I lacked so much in the communication department. No, this is not a redemption or an attempt at a do-over or anything like that really. I just want to express myself properly to you without having to regret anything for the rest of my life. 
    <br><br>    
        

        If we talk about my honest feelings, well... My honest feelings are that I like you. I really- really like you. I like your hair, I really like your eyes, and face, how you dress, well pretty much your whole appearance. Moreover, I adore your voice. I remember that time when we called, how soothing your voice sounded. It was so calming and comforting that I could listen to you talking all day long and I wouldn’t even notice the time passing for days. Even more than that, what I really- really- really like about you is... Well you. Your personality so to speak. The whole vibe you give off. I think that’s because you genuinely are a good person to the core. You care about others, kind and nice and you never intentionally hurt another person. When we get on a sira conversation, it is never not entertaining because for some reason you always seem to find points I can never see and I really admire that about you. This is me trying to talk about the logical reasons why I like you okay? If we were to talk about the reasons that really don’t make any sense, I dunno where to even begin. Well for starters, when I think about you my heart kinda melts yk 😂. Like a sense of comfort, inspirational and lowkey feeling that it’s gonna be all right in the end washes me over. Melting is the poetic word to describe that feeling I guess 😂. Because of all these reasons the only logical conclusion I arrive at is that I am actually not good enough. I mean in the end it is not a bad thing at all, right? You are inspiring me to be a better person. You have that effect on me more than anyone else in the entire world. 
    <br><br>    
        

        After all this you might be wondering, what’s changed about me from before and I still say the same things about you as I've told you before. Something I did bad before is that I thought everything should have a logical reason and if I can control that logic, I can somehow alter the outcome. Therefore, it was sort of like everything was under the scope of my ability to control (Not everything duh.. But you get whut I’m tryna say right?) which made me think that if something didn’t go my way, I was the one entirely at fault. This is not entirely about taking accountability for actions. I don’t know how to explain it properly, but I guess what I learned is that it’s part of the nature that not everything goes the way you want to right? like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9r_pZL4boE">this.</a> I guess it sorta made me see you more humane in a way. For an example let’s take the fact that you never usually start a conversation 😂. I get that it is just you being you. I’m not trying to throw you under the bus okay? Heck, even though I feel sad, I even like that part about you. I think it’s partially also because after all this time, I think I can finally see a teensy bit of how you see yourself in your eyes.  
    <br><br>    
        

        This leads to the conversation we had about love. I think this is the only thing that I can’t help but to not see eye to eye with you. Well hear me out a bit okay? Love is not a feeling that anyone can force themselves to occur, right? It’s a natural phenomenon, or a chemical reaction or whatever that makes sense. The issue arises when we are trying to define what love is neh. Whether ‘expectations’ play a part in that or not, right? No matter how hard I try to think any other way, I can’t help but to see that love without any expectations is so much more like just admiration more than anything else. Perhaps it might seem like there is a hint of greed and selfishness inside the word ‘expectation’. Perhaps there might be. But in my opinion, in this scenario, that is not a bad thing at all. Well, for an example, let’s say that someone is expecting you to be a good person. Regardless of that person’s expectation, if you are actually trying to be a better person, then that expectation is more like a path that guides you in that direction neh. Ultimately what I’m trying to say is that expectations only become a bad thing when your personal opinion or gut the feeling doesn’t align with that expectation. So at the moment, the best definition I could come up for what love is a quote I saw by some dude named ‘Simon Sinek’. What that was, “Love is giving someone the power to destroy you, trusting that they won’t use it.” Of course, this cannot define the entirety of what love stands for because it is so much more than that. But I do agree with the quote wholeheartedly. There is a part of expectation no matter what when it comes to love. But if both are okay with expecting that from each other, ‘trusting that they won’t use the power they were given to destroy the other person,’ I think there is nothing wrong with that. Because that trust is the foundation to a good relationship they build upon. 
    <br><br>    
        

        That brings us to the conversation we had about relationships and why you thought that this wouldn’t work out. Well, I know for a fact that if you ever were to be in a relationship, I wouldn’t be something bland like meet, get married, have kids, live together and die, right? Hell no 😂. Anyways, in my opinion a good relationship is built upon the mutual love between the two people, right? Taking the single assumption that we have a mutual love of some sort into the account, we can say that what we have now is something in-between the levels of a friendship between best friends and a relationship, right? I think the word situationship would describe it correctly right? (Damn I wish this was a conversation cuz I’m really curious to see what your opinion on this is 😂) I guess that happens when we don’t define it huh. I’m actually okay with it really. At least until your A/ls are done with it’s pretty understandable you’d think that being in a relationship with me would be nothing but a distraction. But what I still can’t understand about is that why you think that us being in a relationship would restrict your freedom to do whatever you want in your life. I mean, so far what you told me about those stuff you want to do, I really don’t mind them. In fact, even I want to do some of those myself. I think that second ear piercing looks awesome and hella good on you. I would really like to see you dye your hair. If there is a room for perfection to be more perfect, it’s something like that. I too wanna travel all around the world and see everything, go on wild adventures and stuff. I don’t want to marry until both feel ready to take that step. And hell, I really can’t imagine myself taking on the responsibility to have and raise a kid in the next 10-15 years. If you really think that those were the reasons for you to reject the idea of us being in a relationship it would really make me sad lol. 
    <br><br>    
        

        Now, let’s remove that assumption and think realistically. I really can’t speak about how you feel about me now can I 😂? Honestly, even after all these years, I still can’t seem to figure it out. I’m not so arrogant and confident to assume that you too are into me like I am into you 😂. Actually, I’m thinking in the complete contrary, that you really aren’t into any of this. No no... don’t think it’s because of anything you did okay? You were nothing but nice and caring towards me.  I’m thinking that because why would you be into me in the first place? I’m just a random idiot who’s trying to make your life harder by putting you in uncomfortable situations. Hell, I think there are lot of reasons and flaws on my behalf for this to not work out. Starting with me being a huge hypocrite. Remember that conversation we had after you visited Sithumni? I’m glad we talked about it because ehh, I really don’t like that subject (But we can talk about it anytime if you want to clear up anything alright?). That whole plot happened because of a dumb thing I thought of neh. Ah yess, I even tried to tell you what that reason was once but I guess my embarrassment took the better of me and you thought that I slept or something like that happened neh. Let me get that off the chest as well then lol.  
    <br>    
        If I get straight to the point, I was a jealous dude back then😂. Remember when you told me about Romesh sir’s class and asked you about other people who he teaches? You were trying to deliberately leave out that Dulaj also attended because you knew, it would make me uncomfortable. Well your assumption was absolutely correct 😂. The only issue with that was I already had made that educated guess because I had already seen him follow locca on fb. Me being dumb as bricks, I straight jumped into the conclusion that you two had an affair or something. Ooh yeah facebook was another thing 😂. Seeing other dudes complementing your pictures made me go brr not gonna lie😂. That’s when I realized, thinking like ain’t gonna do me or you any good. I thought that maybe I should just focus on myself and improve my communication skills. And that whole thing we talked about on the day after you visited Sithumni happened after that. Anyways, what I was saying was that I got major flaws like having jealousy issues and letting something like that situation happen and damaging that vow I made to you. (I didn’t use breaking because I knew I was gonna end it right after A/ls and I did, I mean you already know the story. But I do still gotta take accountability for my actions and admit when I’m wrong, right?) Anyways after all this, I can only think for what reasons did I even have the courage to assume that you were into me? I don’t knoww.. 
    <br><br>    
        

        All I know right now is that I love you, I really do. Even though it might not be the way you want to be loved, even though you might not even want me to love you. But I will still do it. I always will. I know that it is not right to ask you this question right after A/ls. But could you imagine a future where we would both love each other wholeheartedly? It really doesn’t matter whether it’s tomorrow, next month or next year even. But can you imagine that happening? I know that it is not a simple binary question where the answer is either yes or no. But you know me right? If the answer is not no, my damned head will only comprehend it as a yes 🥲. If your answer is a no, which is a completely acceptable answer, please do not ever mention about this okay ? 😂. Scratch that thing I asked you about going on a date as well okay? And please, no texts or paragraphs on my birthdays or any other situation, alright? 😂.  Because your words somehow manage to find the way to the weakest point of my heart and strike damn hard. No matter what your answer is, I will always have your best interests at heart. I will always care about you. I will always love you. None of that will ever change.

        P.S: A quick heads up for the next one heheh.. Well I thought I'd fill it with some stuff I think that you would enjoy.. but I think I might've overthought about them a lil bit and I actually couldn't decide on anything smh. So instead I filled it up with some stuff in my own collection. (A perfect opportunity for you to judge my taste heh heh). 
    <br>    
        

        

        Double P.S: Sorry about the box of that rose dome. It was too late when I found that it was pink and had words like love written all over it. I hope I don’t get you in any trouble with your parents or anyone lol.
